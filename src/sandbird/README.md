## Some things need to know sandbird server

### Introduction

[Sandbird](https://github.com/rxi/sandbird) tiny (~800sloc) embeddable HTTP server written in C89, compatible with Linux, OSX and Windows. 

### Use in Hive

As suggested by **sandbird** repo, two **sandbird** sources:

```
sandbird.c
sandbird.h
```

have been dropped into this directory and would be compelled alongside with hive source code.

### Thanks
Thanks to sandbird project and team.
